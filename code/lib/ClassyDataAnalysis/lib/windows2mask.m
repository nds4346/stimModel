    %windows2mask gets a logical index vector by applying time windows to a
    %vector of timestamps.

    %time is a column vector of timestamps. Time is not required to be
    %   sorted for this function
    %windows is a column matrix [tStart1,tEnd1; tStart2,tEnd2; tStart3,
    %   tEnd3; ... ]. The first column has the start time of each window,
    %   and the second column has the end time of each window.
    %the output of windows2mask is a single column vector of 0/1 logical
    %values that serves as a mask for the given windows. Mask will be 1
    %where the values of time fall within any of the given windows, and 0
    %otherwise.
