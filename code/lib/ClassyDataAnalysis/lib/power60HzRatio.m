function RList=power60HzRatio(x)
    %takes a table, where the first column is time (t), and computes the
    %ratio of power in the 60hz harmonics to the total power, the ratio 
    %power of power in the 60hz harmonics to power around 200hz and the
    %ratio of power in the 60hz harmonics to power in the bands immediately
    %adjacent to the harmonics. Results will be presented in tabular
    %format, with each column represinting a ratio, and each row
    %corresponding to one of the columns in x. Only the first 3 harmonics
    %will be considered (60,120 and 180hz). Power at the harmonics is
    %computed in a 10Hz window (+/-5hz on either side of the harmonic).
    %Power adjacent to the harmonic is computed as the mean of the power in
    %the 5Hz bin just below and the 5Hz bin just above the harmonic. E.g.
    %at the 60Hz harmonic the harmonic power is computed from 55-65Hz, and
    %the adjacent power is computed from 50-55Hz, and 65-70Hz. Power around
    %200Hz is computed in the 185-225Hz window
